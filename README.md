This is my first project python (Solid Geometry Calculator)
To see the results, there are 2 ways:
1. Copy the code from main.py and in the terminal section of the code editor, type "streamlit run main.py," or
2. Git clone this project's link, then in your code editor's terminal, type: "streamlit run [github link]"

Thank you and Happy Code ^_^
